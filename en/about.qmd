## Sof Aguiar  

Welcome to my website! ðŸŽ‰  

I'm a Statistics graduate currently researching Public Health and Epidemiology. Here you will find information about me, my work, and my projects.  
The site includes my [CV](cv.qmd), a section of [papers and conference presentations](papers.qmd), a [blog](blog.qmd) with tutorials, and a [portfolio](portfolio.qmd) featuring advanced projects.  

Feel free to explore :)
